# Meals Concept

This project is being inspired by the Meals Application, which was created by [maxschwarzmueller](https://github.com/maxschwarzmueller)
in the [React Native the practical guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-native-the-practical-guide/).

This project contains the fundamental concepts used in every real react native project like:
 * Use Expo as framework to speed up the development
 * **React-navigation** to allow the navigation between screens
 * **Redux** to manage the application state.
   * redux-thunk middleware
   * redux-devtools-extension middleware
   * redux-logger
